        <p>Parcelize is a on-demand parcel delivery application similar to taxi business applications such as Lyft and Uber.
          Due to COVID-19 restrictions, parcels delivery are taking longer than usual and deliveries are being re-routed up to 1500 kilometers detour. This was done to ease pressure off Australia Post(AusPost) workers.
          Small businesses such as e-commerce are having booming business but delivery is affecting customers from receiving their parcels on time. With gig economy in Australia on the rise, parcels would be delivered quicker, perhaps in a matter of hours instead of days(assuming they are intrastate).
          A customer will book a ride and set their parcel’s pickup and drop off points. A rider will then have a list of “jobs” he / she can choose. After choosing the job, the rider will pick up the parcel and the customer will be able to track it.
